## **Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to apply for the Internship Data AI/ML Engineer (F/H) position at Tata Consultancy Services. As a master's student at Centrale Lyon Engineering School, specializing in Data Science, I see this opportunity as a chance to contribute my skills effectively to your team.

I am currently completing the final year of my engineering master’s degree, with a focus on data science and statistics, which has provided me with a strong foundation in **Mathematics, Statistics, and Machine Learning/AI**. My academic journey has equipped me with advanced proficiency in **Python**, statistics, and probability. My training at École Centrale de Lyon has reinforced my technical disciplines, further enhanced by two six-month internships:

1. **Smart Building Engineer Intern at Alter Watt**:
   During my first internship, I developed an IoT-based platform to monitor energy consumption in commercial buildings. This allowed me to hone my skills in **data manipulation, visualization**, and **project management**.

2. **Data Engineer Intern at Finance Doc Multimanagement AG**:
   My second internship involved working with Python/SQL pipelines for an independent financial data provider. I was responsible for maintaining and optimizing the daily data collection process, gaining a solid understanding of **financial markets** and improving my efficiency with Python packages such as **pandas**, **polars**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Flask**. Additionally, I gained experience working with **production** and **development environments** using **Git** for version control.

These experiences have significantly enhanced my **problem-solving skills** and ability to work on real-world projects.

Participating in a challenge organized by **ADEME**, I developed an **LLM (Large Language Model)** to assist users in finding resources related to climate change. This initiative allowed me to further advance my skills in **Machine Learning, LLM development**, and complex problem-solving. We finished ex-aequo with the first group.

I am particularly interested in the responsibilities outlined in your job description, such as designing and developing Python-based web applications, utilizing and understanding Prompt Engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs), and designing and developing web applications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and vector databases. My background in **Python**, **LLMs**, and **web development** aligns well with these requirements.

Additionally, my experience with **CI/CD pipelines**, **cloud-based data storage** using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and **front-end development** using React.js, HTML, and CSS makes me a strong candidate for this position. I am excited about the opportunity to work with Tata Consultancy Services, a company known for its innovation and transformative impact on businesses.

Thank you in advance for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my candidacy in more detail.

**Best regards,**
**Yoan Pontier**
