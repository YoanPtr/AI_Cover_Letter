## **Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to apply for the **Applied AI Engineer Internship** position at **Mistral AI**. As a master's student at Centrale Lyon Engineering School, specializing in Data Science, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to your esteemed team.

I am currently completing the final year of my engineering master’s degree, with a focus on data science and statistics. This academic background has equipped me with a strong foundation in **Mathematics, Statistics, and Machine Learning/AI**, which aligns well with the responsibilities outlined in the job description.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed advanced proficiency in **Python**, which is a key requirement for this role. My training at École Centrale de Lyon has provided me with a solid foundation in technical disciplines, further reinforced by two six-month internships:

1. **Smart Building Engineer Intern at Alter Watt, Paris**:
   During this internship, I researched and developed an IoT-based offer and tools for clients to monitor energy consumption. This experience allowed me to hone my skills in **data manipulation, visualization**, and **project management**, which are crucial for contributing to the deployment of state-of-the-art GenAI applications at Mistral AI.

2. **Data Engineer Intern at Finance Doc Multimanagement AG, Zürich**:
   Here, I maintained and improved an ETL process for extracting financial data, gaining a solid understanding of **financial markets** and improving my efficiency with Python packages such as **pandas**, **polars**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Flask**. Additionally, I gained experience working with **production** and **development environments** using **Git** for version control, which is relevant to the MLOps and deployment aspects of the role.

These experiences have significantly enhanced my **problem-solving skills** and ability to work on real-world projects, making me well-suited to collaborate with researchers, AI engineers, and product engineers on complex customer projects at Mistral AI.

I also participated in a challenge organized by **ADEME**, where I developed an **LLM (Large Language Model)** to assist users in finding resources related to climate change. This initiative allowed me to further advance my skills in **Machine Learning, LLM development**, and complex problem-solving. We finished ex-aequo with the first group, demonstrating my capability to contribute effectively to Mistral AI's product and model capabilities based on customer feedback.

Thank you in advance for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my candidacy in more detail.

**Best regards,**
**Yoan Pontier**
