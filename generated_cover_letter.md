## **Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to apply for the Machine Learning Intern position at MadKudu. As a master's student at Centrale Lyon Engineering School, specializing in Data Science, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to your innovative team and learn from experienced professionals in a fast-paced startup environment.

I am currently completing the final year of my engineering masterâ€™s degree, with a focus on data science and statistics, which has provided me with a robust foundation in **Mathematics, Statistics, and Machine Learning/AI**. My academic journey has equipped me with advanced proficiency in **Python**, as well as key libraries such as **Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Plotly, and Matplotlib**. These skills align well with the requirements of the Machine Learning Intern position at MadKudu.

Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have honed my abilities in data manipulation, visualization, and project management:

1. **Smart Building Engineer Intern at Alter Watt**:
   During this internship, I developed an IoT-based offer and tools for clients to monitor energy consumption. This role allowed me to enhance my skills in **data manipulation, visualization**, and **project management**.

2. **Data Engineer Intern at Finance Doc Multimanagement AG**:
   My responsibilities included maintaining and improving an ETL process for extracting financial data. This experience significantly improved my efficiency with Python packages such as **Pandas, Polars, SQLAlchemy**, and **Flask**. Additionally, I gained experience working with **production** and **development environments** using **Git** for version control.

These experiences have greatly enhanced my **problem-solving skills** and ability to work on real-world projects.

I am particularly excited about MadKudu's mission to optimize revenue automation for B2B SaaS companies and influence how businesses spend their marketing and sales budgets. I am eager to contribute to your AI solutions, maintain existing systems, and learn best practices in machine learning development and deployment. My enthusiasm for learning and applying new concepts, coupled with my strong academic background, makes me a suitable candidate for this role.

Moreover, I have participated in a challenge organized by **ADEME**, where I developed an **LLM (Large Language Model)** to assist users in finding resources related to climate change. This initiative allowed me to further advance my skills in **Machine Learning, LLM development**, and complex problem-solving, which I believe will be valuable in contributing to MadKudu's AI innovations.

Thank you in advance for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my candidacy in more detail.

**Best regards,**
**Yoan Pontier**
